# COSC490-LLMs
This is a repository of my assignments and projects done in my COSC 490 course dedicated to LLMs and apps
The final project is dedicated to building a Dungeon Master chatbot LLM. This is meant to create a simple D&D game using three different AI models for testing.

COSC490Homework1_Hoover - PyTorch Basics

COSC490_Hw2_Hoover - N-gram LM, Build to perdict next word and finish writing wiki pages.

COSC490_Hw3_Hoover - MLP-based Sentiment Classifier

COSC490_HW4 - implement your own subword tokenizer, implement fixed-window MLP language models

490_HW5 - implement our own GPT - Transformer-based language model, learn about how to train and evaluate the GPT LM on GPUs.

h6 - Implement full-parameter finetuning, Explore various parameter-efficient finetuning strategies.
